MORNING The children all sit waiting for school to begin. Some kids are still milling about and taking off their coats. 
KYLE Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning? 
STAN Yeah, it was huge! 
CARTMAN Oh, I hate those things. The kids all look at Cartman puzzlingly. 
KYLE Nobody 
HATES rainbows. 
STAN Yeah, what’s there to 
HATE about rainbows?! 
CARTMAN Well, you know... You’ll just be sitting there minding your own business, and they’ll come marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass - Cartman makes gnashing sounds with his teeth. 
CARTMAN[] And you’ll be all like ‘Hey get out of my

RAINBOWS!!! The boys sit in silence for several seconds... Nobody knows what to say... Finally Stan speaks. 
STAN Cartman, what the 
HELL are you talking about?!?! 
CARTMAN I’m talking about rainbows! I hate those friggin’ things. 
KYLE Rainbows are little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm! Cartman thinks long and hard. 
CARTMAN Ohhhhhh.... 
RAINBOWS. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool. Stan, Kyle and Kenny stare at Cartman in disbelief. 
STAN What were 
YOU talking about?! 
CARTMAN Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it. 
KYLE No! What marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?!

BEBE stands in front of the curtain in a little dress.

MAYOR

MCDANIELS Oh, don’t they look adorable? 
BEBE Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers... Suddenly, all the children who were dressed as pioneers come 
CHARGING onto the stage and immediately start beating the crap out of the kids dressed as Indians. The Mayor watches in horror as the Indians are pummeled senseless by the pioneers. 
MAYOR

MCDANIELS Oh my God!! 
MR.

NIGHT The classroom is dark and silent. The door 
CREEKS open and a shaft of blue moonlight spills through. Wendy pokes her head in. 
WENDY (in a whisper) Hello? She tiptoes to the back of the room and opens a file cabinet. Inside is a manila envelope labeled ‘Save Our Planet Essay Contest.’ She opens the folder and flips through the papers. She comes to her paper, which the judges have scored with a big circled 72 written on it and the phrase ‘Good Try Little girl - But if dolphins are so smart, why do they get caught in fishing nets all the time?’ Wendy grinds her teeth and fumes for a moment. After a few more papers, she comes to the one with a big blue ribbon on it. It is an incredibly thick essay, nearly 300 pages. Wendy pulls it out and starts to read it out loud. 
WENDY (Reading) My Essay - By Eric Cartman... When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods on the shore of... The door opens! Wendy shoves the paper in her jacket and drops behind a desk. A dark figure moves across the classroom. Wendy peeks up and sees Mr. Garrison taking off his overcoat. He sits down at his desk, flips on a lamp, and throws Mr. Hat on a chair. 
MR. 
. GARRISON
GARRISON Well Mr. Hat, I guess ol’ Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow... Mr. Hat sits limp on the chair. Mr. Garrison starts to polish his gun. 
MR. 
. GARRISON
GARRISON She beat us in the talent show all those years ago... And I think we 
OWE her for that! Wendy peeks out from behind the desk. Garrison points the gun and looks through the sight.

BANG!!!
